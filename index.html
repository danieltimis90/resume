    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p> I enjoy solving problems, the harder the problem, the greater the satisfaction when I finally solve it. I have worked as a
        embedded developer for the past years but have also worked on projects that not entirely in this domain. I have a strong
        working ethic I developed during the various jobs I held in my forming years in various lines of work unrelated to IT.
